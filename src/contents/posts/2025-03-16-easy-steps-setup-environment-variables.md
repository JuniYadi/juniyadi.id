## Introduction

Environment variables are a crucial part of any development environment. They allow you to configure settings and paths that your applications need to run correctly. In this tutorial, we will guide you through setting up environment variables on your local machine, covering Linux, macOS, and Windows. We will also provide examples for popular tools like Java, Python, Node.js, AWS CLI, and Cloudflare Workers.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have basic command line knowledge and access to a terminal or command prompt on your operating system.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Setting Up on Linux

#### Using `.bashrc`

1. Open your terminal.
2. Edit the `.bashrc` file in your home directory:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

3. Add your environment variable:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/path/to/java"
```

4. Save and exit the editor.
5. Apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Setting Up on macOS

#### Using `.zshrc`

1. Open your terminal.
2. Edit the `.zshrc` file in your home directory:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

3. Add your environment variable:

```bash:.zshrc
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/python"
```

4. Save and exit the editor.
5. Apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Setting Up on Windows

#### Using System Properties

1. Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables."
2. Click "Edit the system environment variables."
3. In the System Properties window, click "Environment Variables."
4. Under "System variables," click "New" and add your variable:
   - Name: `NODE_PATH`
   - Value: `C:\path\to\nodejs`
5. Click OK to save.

### Temporary vs. Permanent Variables

- **Temporary:** Set in the terminal session and lost after closing.

```bash
export TEMP_VAR="temporary"
```

- **Permanent:** Set in configuration files like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

### Examples

- **Java:** `export JAVA_HOME="/path/to/java"`
- **Python:** `export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/python"`
- **Node.js:** `export NODE_PATH="/path/to/nodejs"`
- **AWS CLI:** `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"`
- **Cloudflare Workers:** `export CF_API_TOKEN="your_api_token"`

## Common Issues and Fixes

- **Syntax Errors:** Ensure no spaces around `=` in variable assignments.
- **Incorrect Paths:** Double-check file paths for typos.
- **Source Files:** Make sure to reload the configuration file after changes.

## Analysis Techniques

- Use `echo $VARIABLE_NAME` to check if a variable is set.
- Use `env` or `printenv` to list all environment variables.

## Conclusion

Setting up environment variables is a fundamental skill for developers. By following this guide, you can ensure your development environment is configured correctly across different operating systems.
